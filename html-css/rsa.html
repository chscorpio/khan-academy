    <h1>Explaining RSA Encryption to a 5th Grader</h1>
    <p>Let’s imagine RSA encryption is like sending a secret message using <strong>locks and keys</strong>. Here’s how it works:</p>

    <h2>1. Pick Two Secret Numbers (The Lock)</h2>
    <p>Think of two numbers as your "locks." These numbers are special because they are <span class="important">prime numbers</span> (numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves). For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One number might be <strong>3</strong>.</li>
        <li>Another number might be <strong>5</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We multiply these numbers together to create a bigger number. That big number becomes part of the lock!</p>

    <h2>2. Share Part of Your Lock (The Public Key)</h2>
    <p>You share the big number and another small number with your friends. This is called the <strong>public key</strong>. It’s like leaving a lock open but hiding the key to unlock it.</p>

    <h2>3. Keep Your Key a Secret</h2>
    <p>There’s a special math rule that creates a <span class="important">secret key</span>. Only you know this key. It’s like the magic that lets you unlock the lock you shared earlier.</p>

    <h2>4. How to Send a Secret Message</h2>
    <p>Your friend wants to send you a secret message, so they:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn their message into numbers. For example, the letter "a" might be <strong>1</strong>, and "b" might be <strong>2</strong>.</li>
        <li>They use your public lock (public key) to lock their message. Only your secret key can unlock it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. How to Unlock the Message</h2>
    <p>When you get the message, you use your secret key to unlock it. The numbers turn back into letters, and now you can read the secret message!</p>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>A Fun Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You pick <strong>3</strong> and <strong>5</strong> as your secret numbers. The big number is <strong>3 × 5 = 15</strong>.</li>
            <li>You share the number <strong>15</strong> and another small number (like <strong>3</strong>) with your friends.</li>
            <li>Your friend writes the letter "m" (which is <strong>13</strong>) and uses the lock to scramble it into a new number, like <strong>4</strong>.</li>
            <li>When you get the number <strong>4</strong>, you use your secret key to turn it back into <strong>13</strong> and read "m."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Why Is It Cool?</h2>
    <p>Even if someone sees the public lock (the big number), they can’t figure out your secret key easily because math is tricky like that. It’s a great way to keep secrets safe!</p>

    <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
    <p>You’ve just learned how RSA encryption works in a simple way. It’s like a magic trick with numbers, but it’s super important for keeping things private on the internet!</p>
